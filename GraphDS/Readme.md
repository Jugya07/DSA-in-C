## Graph
- collection of  vertices and edges connecting these vertices  
- Directed Edge - One way connection  
- Undirected Edge - Two way connection  
- Directed Graph -  All directed edges   
- Undirected Graph - All undirected edges  
- Indegree - No of edges going out of the node  
- Outdegree - No of edges coming in the node
